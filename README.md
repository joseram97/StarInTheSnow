README
This project is a personal project for myself to create a ios platforming game and to tell my Father's story for without his determination and my mom's love for him since the age of 16, my brothers and I would never exist here

This game should incorperate musical elements into its core gameplay when platforming. An enemy A.I. system can be created but I am currently figuring out what the enemy's will be. There may be no enemies at all and is just purely a platforming/musical story game. One of the main tools/weapons the game should use primarily is a "Moveable" piano
